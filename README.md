# Bike Sharing Washington DC ðŸš²
This repository contains an analysis and one-step ahaed forcasting of bike sharing demand in Washington DC

## Context
Climate change is forcing cities to re-imaging their transportation infrastructure. Shared mobility concepts, such as car sharing, bike sharing or scooter sharing become more and more popular. And if they are implemented well, they can actually contribute to mitigating climate change. Bike sharing in particular is interesting because no electricity of gasoline is necessary (unless e-bikes are used) for this mode of transportation. However, there are inherent problems to this type of shared mobility:

* varying demand at bike sharing stations needs to be balanced to avoid oversupply or shortages
* Heavily used bikes break down more often

Forecasting the future demand can help address those issues. Moreover, demand forecasts can help operators decide whether to expand the business, determine adequate prices and generate additional income through advertisements at particularly busy stations. But that's not all. Another challenge is redistributing bikes between stations and determining the optimal routes. And determining the location of new stations is also an area of interest for operators.

## Content
This dataset can be used to forecast demand to avoid oversupply and shortages. It spans from January 1, 2011, until December 31, 2018. Determining new station locations, analyzing movement patterns or planning routes will only be possible with additional data.
